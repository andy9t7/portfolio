      <description>Lesson 1: Setting the Scene Lesson 2: Active Learning Strategies for Collaborative Small Group Teaching In engineering, I believe using both summative and formative assessments are appropriate. Both of these types of assessments allow me to assess student learning and give me opportunities to give and receive feedback. This is especially important as it allows both parties, the teacher and the student, to evaluate our work. It allows myself to assess the effectiveness of my teaching and the student to evaluate their learning and understanding.</description>

      <description>Introduction “By learning you will teach; by teaching you will learn”
This is a quote that has resonated with me throughout my years as a student, and more recently as a teacher - it concisely summarises my teaching philosophy.
My teaching philosophy was first sparked from a short exchange with my Supervisor while I was preparing for my first class, &amp;lsquo;Mechanisms and Machines&amp;rsquo;, a farily difficult course. Seeing that I was stressing out revising the content I learned a few years back, he jokingly told me &amp;ldquo;You never really learn something until you have taught it&amp;rdquo;.</description>

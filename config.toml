# Description
description = "Hi! My name is Andy Huynh. I am a PhD student who is currently doing research in computational modelling and simulation of the human brain. I enjoy academic teaching and find it rewarding to help students understand difficult concepts and topics in Mechanical Engineering. I do many personal side projects alongside my research (i often get side-tracked ðŸ˜­) which I will be updating on my website."

## Lesson 1: Setting the Scene


## Lesson 2: Active Learning Strategies for Collaborative Small Group Teaching
In engineering, I believe using both summative and formative assessments are appropriate. Both of these types of assessments allow me to assess student learning and give me opportunities to give and receive feedback. This is especially important as it allows both parties, the teacher and the student, to evaluate our work. It allows myself to assess the effectiveness of my teaching and the student to evaluate their learning and understanding.

There are many methods under each type of assessments that is available to be used under certain circumstances. For formative assessment, the methods are useful in a tutorial/practical/workshop environment as they are quick and easy to carry out. For example, I believe group discussions and quizzes to be the most useful methods for an engineering class. In engineering, there are many technical concepts which are taught, and sometime, it can be difficult for students to keep up due to the volume that is covered. As such, regular quizzes and group discussions allows the students to take a step back to evaluate their understanding and review the material. In addition, summative assessments are useful for larger projects that checks the cumulative understanding of the student. In this case, an analytic type of rubric which assigns different weights to different criteria to assess students will be appropriate. Projects assess students in many different areas and hence, having more specific feedback on which area the students are doing well in or needs further help will be useful for both teachers and students.
